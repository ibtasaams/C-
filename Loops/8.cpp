/*David needs to lower his cholesterol count to stay physically fit and reduce the risk of 
heart attack, and he wants to accomplish this by doing regular exercises. He decided 
to join a gym and, among other measures, keep track of the number of calories burned 
each time he uses the gym. At the end of each week he wants to determine the aver
age number of calories burned each day. We need to write a program that David can 
use to enter the number of calories burned each day and get as output the average 
number of calories burned each day. Suppose that the numbers of calories burned 
each day in a particular week are: 375, 425, 270, 190, 350, 200, and 365. To find the 
average number of calories burned each day, we must add these numbers and divide 
the total by 7. From what we have learned so far, we can write the following program 
to find the average number of calories burned each day*/
